        <p>The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), as implemented by Regulation C, requires<sup>1</sup> financial institutions
subject to the law and regulation (HMDA reporters) to collect and report certain data fields about applications,
originations, and purchases of &ldquo;covered loans.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup> It is important that HMDA reporters
accurately collect and report HMDA data because of the critical purposes for which the data are used. For example,
examiners use HMDA data for fair lending examinations, compliance examinations, and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)
examinations, while public officials use the data for making decisions about distributing public-sector
investments.<sup>3</sup> Policymakers also review and analyze HMDA data for insights into the mortgage market. Given
the importance of accurate data for these purposes, the tolerance threshold for the percentage of errors requiring
the reporter to resubmit its data is low, ranging from 2.5 percent to 10 percent, depending on the number of HMDA
loans reported.<sup>4</sup> Errors exceeding the tolerance can result in data resubmission, examination delays,
regulatory violations, and civil money penalties.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>HMDA data collection and reporting can be challenging. HMDA reporters must collect multiple data fields, some of
which have nuanced requirements. For example, prequalifications are not reported, while applications for a home
purchase loan in preapproval programs generally are. Similarly, the &ldquo;action taken&rdquo; field has multiple
options with particular requirements, such as reporting the action taken as &ldquo;withdrawn&rdquo; only when the
applicant withdraws the application before a credit decision is made to approve or deny the application or before
the file is closed because it is incomplete.<sup>6</sup> It is therefore not surprising that HMDA violations were
among the top 10 compliance violations cited by Federal Reserve examiners even before the Dodd‒Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd‒Frank Act) and its implementing regulations required HMDA reporters to
begin collecting additional data fields beginning in January 2018 and made changes to some of the existing fields.
</p>
<p>Technical changes, frequent violations, and the need for accurate data underscore the importance of discussing ways
that reporting institutions can strengthen their HMDA data collection, verification, and reporting processes. This
article discusses sound practices identified by examiners and suggests compliance management program improvements to
help financial institutions strengthen their HMDA collecting and reporting practices. The article&rsquo;s
suggestions should be considered in the context of the size, complexity, and risk profile of the HMDA reporter. We
begin by discussing the role of the board of directors and management, provide a brief overview of the law&rsquo;s
requirements, and finish by reviewing sound practices to improve compliance.</p>
<h2>Role of Board of Directors and Senior Management</h2>
<p>For HMDA reporters, management is responsible for ensuring procedures are in place to collect and maintain accurate
data regarding each loan application, loan origination, and loan purchase that must be reported. Further, the board
and management also need to ensure the institution provides individuals assigned responsibility for preparing and
maintaining the data appropriate training regarding the regulatory requirements, resources, and tools needed to
report complete and accurate HMDA data.</p>
<em>
<h3><span>Data Collection</span></h3>
</em>
<p>Sound practices for successful data collection include creating effective procedures, providing useful tools to staff
members responsible for HMDA data collection, and delivering comprehensive training. The following strategies are
suggested to help achieve an effective HMDA program.</p>
<em>
<h3><span>Procedures</span></h3>
</em>
<p>Successful data collection starts with developing HMDA data collection procedures. Effective HMDA procedures document
processes for identifying all HMDA reportable transactions and develop consistent approaches for identifying the
underlying source of information for reporting data fields on the HMDA loan application register (LAR) to ensure
accurate data collection.</p>
<h2>Overview of the Law&rsquo;s Requirements</h2>
<h3><em>Who Must Report</em></h3>
<p>First, the institution must be a &ldquo;financial institution&rdquo; as defined by Regulation C. Although HMDA
applies to both depository and nondepository financial institutions, this article only addresses the requirements
for depository institutions.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Asset-Size Threshold.</strong> On December 31 of the preceding year, the institution meets the requisite
    asset-size threshold, which is published annually in the <em>Federal Register</em>. For data collection in 2020,
    the current asset threshold is $47 million.</li>
    <li><strong>Location Test.</strong> On December 31 of the preceding year, the institution had a home or branch
    location located in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA).</li>
    <li><strong>Loan Activity Test.</strong> During the preceding calendar year, the institution originated at least one
    home purchase loan or refinance of a home purchase loan secured by a first lien on a one-to four-unit dwelling.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Federally Related Test.</strong> The institution is (a) federally insured; (b) federally regulated; or
    (c) originated at least one home purchase or refinance of a home purchase loan that was secured by a first lien
    on a one-to four-unit dwelling and (i) was insured, guaranteed, or supplemented by a federal agency or (ii) was
    intended for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
    Corporation (Freddie Mac).</li>
    <li><strong>Loan-Volume Threshold.</strong> Effective July 1, 2020, the institution meets or exceeds either the
    closed-end mortgage loan or the open-end line of credit loan-volume threshold in each of the two preceding
    calendar years. Currently, an institution that originated at least 100 closed-end mortgage loans in each of the
    two preceding calendar years,<sup>7</sup> or originated at least 500 open-end lines of credit in each of the two
    preceding calendar years meets or exceeds the loan-volume threshold for the respective loan category. The
    open‑end line credit threshold of 500 is temporary with the permanent 200‑loan threshold effective on January 1,
    2022 (i.e., data collection would occur in 2022, with reporting in 2023).<sup>8</sup></li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Identifying HMDA Reportable Transactions</em></h3>
<p>Once an institution confirms it is covered by HMDA, the next step in the data collection and reporting process is to
identify all HMDA reportable transactions. The Dodd‒Frank Act amendments that became effective in January 2018
changed which transactions are deemed covered by HMDA and Regulation C and therefore reportable. Generally speaking,
unless a transaction is expressly excluded under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5a832683c2b7024f21c222c7a34e5cf5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.8.1003_13&amp;rgn=div8">12
C.F.R. &sect;1003.3(c)</a>, an institution subject to HMDA must report all consumer
closed‑end mortgage loans and open-end lines of credit secured by a dwelling.<sup>9</sup> For business or
commercial-purpose loans secured by a dwelling, the loan is reportable only if it can be categorized as a
refinancing, home improvement, or home purchase loan.<sup>10</sup> The 2018 amendments also modified the definitions
of <em>institutional coverage</em><sup>11</sup> and <em>transactional coverage</em>.<sup>12</sup> In addition, the
2018 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA)<sup>13</sup> partially exempted some
HMDA reporters from collecting most of the newer HMDA fields added by the Dodd‒Frank Act and implementing
regulations.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>Over or underreporting transactions on the HMDA LAR can lead to noncompliance. Further, HMDA requires the collection
of government monitoring information (GMI), which includes the race, ethnicity, and sex of the applicant(s) for the
transactions reported on the HMDA LAR. An institution that incorrectly determines whether HMDA applies to a
particular transaction could collect GMI when it is not required, or fail to collect it when it is, resulting in
examination violations and potential fair lending issues.<sup>15</sup></p>
<h3><em>Transactional Requirements<sup>16</sup></em></h3>
<p>HMDA reporting requirements apply to loans or applications that satisfy the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A consumer open- or closed-end loan secured by a dwelling;</li>
    <li>A business-purpose loan secured by a dwelling that is a refinance, home purchase, or home improvement loan, as
    those terms are defined in &sect;1003.2(i), (j), and (p), respectively; and</li>
    <li>The application or loan is not on the list of excluded transactions in 12 C.F.R. &sect;1003.3(c), which
    includes:
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>Loans originated or purchased by the financial institution acting in a fiduciary capacity;</li>
        <li>Loans secured by a lien on unimproved land;</li>
        <li>Temporary financing;</li>
        <li>Purchase of an interest in a pool of otherwise covered loans;</li>
        <li>Purchase of solely the right to service loans;</li>
        <li>Purchase of loans as part of a merger or acquisition;</li>
        <li>Loans in which the total dollar amount is less than $500;</li>
        <li>Purchase of partial interest in an otherwise covered loan;</li>
        <li>Loans used primarily for agricultural purposes;</li>
        <li>Loans made primarily for business or commercial purposes, unless the transaction is also a home
        improvement loan, home purchase loan, or refinancing; and/or</li>
        <li>A transaction that proposed to provide or did provide new funds in advance of being consolidated in a
        New York State consolidation, extension, and modification agreement.<sup>17</sup></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Partial Exemption<sup>18</sup></em></h3>
<p>The EGRRCPA partially exempted certain HMDA reporters. In particular, reporters that were insured depository
institutions or insured credit unions and originated fewer than 500 closed‑end mortgage loans or open-end lines of
credit in each of the two preceding calendar years do not have to collect and report most of the new fields added by
the CFPB&rsquo;s 2015 final rule implementing the Dodd‒Frank Act amendments to HMDA. But even if a HMDA reporter is
partially exempt, it must still collect and report the nonexempt data points. We list the exempt fields in Table 1
(The Effect of EGRRCP Act&rsquo;s Partial Exemption for Certain HMDA Data Points) along with the fields that all
HMDA reporters are still required to collect.</p>

<p style="font-size: small;">* The Age field was added by &sect;1094 of the Dodd‒Frank Act, but the EGRRCPA amendment
did not include this field
in the partial exemption, so even banks qualifying for the partial exemption must still collect and report this new
field.</p>
<p>To qualify for the partial exemption, an institution must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Be an&nbsp;<em>insured credit union</em>&nbsp;or an&nbsp;<em>insured depository
    institution</em><sup>19</sup>&nbsp;that has not been rated either &ldquo;needs to improve record of meeting
    community credit needs&rdquo; during each of its two most recent CRA examinations or not rated
    &ldquo;substantial noncompliance in meeting community credit needs&rdquo;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;on its most recent
    CRA examination;</li>
    <li>Originate fewer than 500 closed-end mortgage loans in each of the two preceding calendar years (to be partially
    exempt for its closed-end loans);<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;or</li>
    <li>Originate fewer than 500 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years (to be partially
    exempt for its open-end lines of credit).<sup>22</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The open- and closed-end exemptions operate independently from each other; an institution may qualify for one partial
exemption but not the other.</p>
<p>Further, business lines other than those offering traditional residential mortgages may offer credit extensions that
require the institutions to collect and report HMDA data. For example, the commercial loan department may originate
purchase-money loans for multifamily buildings such as apartment, cooperative, or condominium buildings. Originating
HMDA-reportable transactions in multiple business lines makes identifying and collecting data more challenging, and
staff in nonmortgage origination business lines may not be as mindful of HMDA requirements in day-to-day operations.
Table 2 (Business Lines and Reportable Transactions) depicts the business lines that often offer loans subject to
HMDA as well as the types of HMDA-reportable transactions often found within each business line. As a reminder, this
table is illustrative; other types of loans may be HMDA reportable.</p>

<p style="font-size: small;">* The prior version of Regulation C used a &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; test (refinance,
purchase, or home improvement loan) for all loans to determine if a loan was HMDA reportable. The purpose test now
only applies to dwelling-secured loans with a business or commercial purpose.</p>
<p>Institutions have different methods of ensuring that they accurately identify HMDA-reportable transactions. At some
institutions, lenders are initially responsible for identifying HMDA-related applications, and the compliance
department confirms lenders identified all covered applications by comparing the new loan list with the HMDA LAR.
Larger reporters often use automated systems to identify HMDA-reportable transactions. It is also important that
financial institutions have a process to track nonoriginated loan applications, such as denied, withdrawn, approved
but not accepted, or incomplete applications that have a HMDA purpose. If an institution has a largely manual HMDA
process, a centralized review of all nonoriginated loan applications can help ensure the institution reports
nonoriginated applications appropriately.</p>

<h2>Sound Practices</h2>
<h3><em>Ensuring Accurate Data Collection</em></h3>
<p>After identifying HMDA reportable transactions, an institution&rsquo;s next step is to collect accurate data. This
step requires attention to detail because of the large number of data fields collected for each application and a
solid understanding of HMDA&rsquo;s requirements, given the complexity of the regulation and certain HMDA
transactions. Additionally, depending on the capabilities of the bank&rsquo;s application and loan systems, data are
not always readily accessible to be collected, especially when multiple business lines and staff are involved in
providing data. Because of these factors, some banks have found that developing staff with specialized HMDA
proficiency improves HMDA compliance.</p>
<p>Deciding how an organization will handle certain HMDA scenarios, such as determining the specific information to
report (for which the regulation allows some latitude), eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency across business
lines. Some examples of situations in which the bank should determine in advance how it will respond include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using the date of the adverse action notice to determine the action taken date for denied applications (rather
    than using the date of the decision to deny the application, which could be a different date);</li>
    <li>Using the date the lender receives the application as the application date for originated loans (rather than the
    date on the application which could be different);</li>
    <li>Determining which credit bureau score to report if more than one score was used in making the credit decision
    because the regulation requires that only one of the scores used be reported.</li>
</ul>
<p>Centralizing data collection can be an effective way to reduce reporting errors by reducing the number of people in
the data collection process. As part of the centralized process, financial institutions may designate a HMDA subject
matter expert (SME) to serve as the central point of contact for data collection and reporting. A well-trained SME
can serve as a reliable resource for all individuals involved in HMDA data collection processes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the institution&rsquo;s procedures should help ensure compliance with Regulation C&rsquo;s requirement
that a covered institution record a transaction on the LAR within calendar days after the end of the calendar
quarter, in which it takes final action on the transaction (such as origination or purchase of a loan or denial of
an application).</p>
<h3><em>Tools</em></h3>
<p>Providing tools for staff, such as flow charts, worksheets, and industry materials, can also aid in the collection
process. Flow charts may include guidance that helps staff decide whether a transaction is HMDA reportable. HMDA
worksheets are an effective way for helping staff collect data on all key fields during the loan application
process. Worksheets may include references on where to find information in the loan file or reminders about
HMDA&rsquo;s requirements. For example, the worksheet may indicate where to find gross income in the file, depending
on the loan type, and could include a reference of when income should be reported as not applicable. Cheat sheets
may remind staff how to geocode the collateral securing the loan. Finally, providing copies of industry guidance,
such as the <em>HMDA Getting it Right!</em> booklet or the <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_hmda_small-entity-compliance-guide.pdf"><em>HMDA Small
Entity Compliance Guide</em></a>, also helps staff understand HMDA data collection requirements, especially
when they encounter unfamiliar or complex transactions.</p>
<p>Many banks find that using an automated collection process reduces the burden of compiling HMDA data. Automated
collection offers a consistent process, using the information entered during loan origination as source
documentation for HMDA data. The level of automation may vary from bank to bank, usually depending on factors such
as origination volume and institutional complexity. Some financial institutions use their loan processing system to
determine geocodes. Other institutions use data collection software to compile the entire LAR. Examples of automated
processes for the new HMDA data fields include calculating the applicant&rsquo;s age based on birthdate as opposed
to staff manually entering the date or using software that automates the process of extracting HMDA data from the
lender&rsquo;s origination software to ensure the information is in the correct format for the HMDA LAR prior to
submitting it.</p>
<h3><em>Training</em></h3>
<p>Regular in-depth training is an effective tool to ensure staff understand HMDA data collection requirements. Whether
using a centralized or decentralized process, or a hybrid of both, it is important that all staff members involved
in the process understand reporting requirements and that the bank applies collection procedures consistently.
Effective training reflects each individual&rsquo;s role in the collection process and provides sufficient detail to
aid staff in identifying the transactions to be reported and the data to collect. Effective training also helps
staff understand regulatory requirements and internal HMDA procedures. Regular training helps staff stay up to date
on the rules and helps create consistency among business lines and staff involved in the HMDA process.</p>
<p>Training is particularly beneficial for some of HMDA&rsquo;s more complicated requirements in which data reporting
errors are more common. Some training topics that could be addressed are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How to properly report denials, withdrawals, and multiple use loans;</li>
    <li>The nuances in reporting data fields that depend on specific calculations, such as borrower age, borrower credit
    score, and origination fees/closing costs; and</li>
    <li>The interface between the core system and the automated collection software.</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Data Verification</em></h3>
<p>Before submitting its HMDA data, an institution can perform a comprehensive review to verify the accuracy of the data
collected compared with the source documentation within the loan files to identify and correct any errors and
increase the accuracy of the reported information. Depending on the volume of data collected, this process may
involve testing through sampling. An effective verification process gives the financial institution an opportunity
to measure the accuracy of its collection and reporting processes and identify weaknesses that may exist. The
verification should also test the effectiveness of processes used to identify all applicable HMDA loans and
nonoriginated applications.</p>
<p>The data review can be conducted internally or by a reputable third-party vendor. The strength of the
institution&rsquo;s data collection processes should determine the scope and frequency of the review. The risk of
HMDA noncompliance may be greater for institutions with a high origination volume or a decentralized collection
process. Reviews may uncover errors that can range from simple typographical errors to more significant procedural
errors that could lead to systemic reporting violations, data scrubs, and resubmission. If the review identifies
errors, the institution should correct the data prior to submission. When weaknesses are noted, the severity of the
weaknesses should be assessed and appropriate corrective actions taken to address the root cause. A thorough data
verification process provides a much-needed last line of defense for HMDA reporters.</p>
<h3><em>Data Reporting</em></h3>
<p>In addition to data collection, institutions can also develop procedures and training for individuals responsible for
reporting collected HMDA data. An institution reporting fewer than 60,000 covered loans and applications in the
preceding calendar year must submit its prior year&rsquo;s LAR to its primary federal regulator by March
1.<sup>24</sup> Institutions reporting more than 60,000 covered loans and application in the preceding calendar year
must submit the data within 60 calendar days after the end of each quarter, except the fourth one.<sup>25</sup> But
note, as discussed in endnote 27, the Bureau and the Federal Reserve have temporarily relaxed enforcement of the
quarterly reporting requirement. A separate and complete LAR must be transmitted for each covered institution. For
example, one LAR must be submitted for a bank and a separate LAR for a subsidiary of the bank. A number of tools are
available to ensure the LAR meets submission standards.</p>
<p>The LAR must be submitted electronically as a text file using the <em>HMDA Filing Platform</em> (the platform) from
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC).<sup>26</sup> The platform will automatically check
the file for syntactical, validity, quality, and macro edits. If there are any errors, the system will notify the
institution immediately. Any errors must be corrected at the source level, and the entire LAR must be uploaded
again. Once the completed LAR has been uploaded, an approved representative must certify it and mark it as complete.
Questions around the filing process can be answered at the FFIEC&rsquo;s website at <a href="https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/">https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/</a>, which provides a number of tools to assist
institutions, including the Filing Instruction Guide, the Supplemental Guide for Quarterly Filers, and the
Self-Service Knowledge Portal, which answers frequently asked questions on HMDA.</p>
<p>Institutions that report a small volume of covered loans can use the <em>LAR Formatting Tool</em> to help create an
electronic file for submission.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>Navigating the nuances of HMDA collection and reporting can be challenging, especially because of the changes that
became effective in 2018. Table 4 (Sound HMDA Practices) lists the processes we have observed at institutions with
effective HMDA data collection and reporting processes.</p>

<p>While this list is not exhaustive, most institutions can implement these practices, regardless of the size and
structure of the HMDA program. It is important to determine the institution&rsquo;s risk profile, assess the level
of knowledge within the institution, commit the necessary resources to the process, and apply the practices best
suited for the level of risk and resources.</p>
<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Implementing sound practices can help improve the HMDA data collection and reporting process. Whether the process is
centralized or decentralized, establishing and consistently applying collection, verification, and reporting
processes will give bank staff a solid foundation for ensuring complete and accurate data collection and reporting.
Combined with adequate training, effective job aids and timely HMDA data reviews, the institution can leverage these
sound practices and develop a HMDA process that will strengthen its compliance management program. Specific issues
and questions related to Regulation C should be raised with the institution&rsquo;s primary regulator.</p>

coverage. Because consumer dwelling-secured loans can now have other purposes and still be covered, the purpose
field was amended to add a new option &ldquo;or for a purpose <em>other than</em> home purchase, home improvement,
refinancing, or cash-out refinancing.&rdquo; 12 C.F.R. &sect;1003.4(a)(3).</p>

132 Stat. 1296 (2018) at Section 104</a>. The open- and closed-end exemptions are independent of each other. For
example, an institution reporting more than 500 closed-end HMDA loans and 100 open-end loans would be required to
report the closed-end loans but would be exempt from reporting the open-end loans.</p>

Protection Bureau <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/supervisory-guidance/statement-quarterly-reporting-home-mortgage-disclosure-act/">announced</a>
that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, &ldquo;until further notice, the Bureau does not intend to cite in an
examination or initiate an enforcement action against any institution for failure to report its HMDA data
quarterly&rdquo; for institutions reporting 60,000 or more covered loans.&rdquo; The Federal Reserve Board made a
similar announcement. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr2006.htm">See CA letter
