			<p><strong>2024</strong> – FFIEC data was updated to incorporate the MSA/MD boundary changes from <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/OMB-Bulletin-23-01.pdf">OMB Bulletin 23-01</a>. </p>
			
			<p><strong>County changes</strong> </p>
				<p>All 8 counties in Connecticut were replaced with 9 new planning regions as per the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/06/06/2022-12063/change-to-county-equivalents-in-the-state-of-connecticut">Federal Register Notice</a> released on June 6, 2022. These changes are now incorporated into the FFIEC data.</p><br />
				
			
		    <p><strong>2023</strong> – FFIEC flat files were updated to use DHC data in place of Redistricting data. Fields for the four island areas were also populated. Redistricting data field numbers are still included in the documentation for ease of use.</p><br />
			
			<p><strong>2022</strong> – Changes to several of the ACS tables used by the FFIEC have resulted in significant changes to the fields available in the 2022 Census Reports. Please review the flat file definitions documentation carefully. Additionally, the 2020 Demographic Housing Characteristics (DHC) files are not yet available, so this year uses the 2020 Census Redistricting file where appropriate.</p>
